<h3>1. The Little Prince</h3>
<p>This movie is adapted from a french childerns' story book and deals with 
   topics like growing up, relationships and parting away. I enjoyed watching this movie.

<h3>2. Coraline</h3>
<p>This movie is also adapted from a childrens' story book of the same name. This movie is very spooky and deals with 
   interdimentional horror, loneliness and family. I really enjoyed the nuances and animation.
